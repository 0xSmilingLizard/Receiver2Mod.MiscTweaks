# MiscTweaks
 
A mod for `Receiver 2`, that lets you tweak killdrone lights (color and intensity of the various states) and alert volume (both beeps and the camera's alarm).

## install

Install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) into the Receiver 2 folder, then start and exit Receiver 2 to have BepInEx generate its folder structure.
Then place the MiscTweaks folder in `BepInEx/plugins`.

It is recommended to use [BepInEx's Config Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) (installed the same way as this mod) to have an in-game UI to make the tweaks.
